title: Textual paraphrase dataset for deep language modeling
layout: page
---

The project gathered a large dataset of Finnish paraphrase pairs (over 100,000) accompanied by a small test set of Swedish paraphrases. The paraphrases are selected and classified manually, so as to minimize lexical overlap, and provide examples that are maximally structurally and lexically different. The objective is to create a dataset which is challenging and better tests the capabilities of natural language understanding. An important feature of the data is that most paraphrase pairs are distributed in their document context. The primary application for the dataset is the development and evaluation of deep language models, and representation learning in general. The project is funded by the [European Language Grid](https://www.european-language-grid.eu/expo-projects/textual-paraphrase-dataset-for-deep-language-modeling/) (2020-2021) and the Academy of Finland (2021-2023).

## Data and model download

* The full manually **annotated dataset** is on [GitHub](https://github.com/TurkuNLP/Turku-paraphrase-corpus) and the [European Language Grid](https://live.european-language-grid.eu/catalogue/corpus/7754)
* A **model** trained on this data to classify text segment pairs into the various classes of paraphrase is documented and downloadble in the following notebook [[GitHub]](https://github.com/TurkuNLP/Turku-paraphrase-models/blob/main/para_notebook.ipynb) [[Colab]](https://colab.research.google.com/github/TurkuNLP/Turku-paraphrase-models/blob/main/para_notebook.ipynb)
* A collection of **paraphrase candidates** (both positive and negative) gathered using the above model and useful for further training in a straightforward classification setup is downloadable (to appear)
* A Finnish **SentenceBERT** model fine-tuned on the data is available for download (to appear)

## Documentation and publications

* An initial release of the data is described in [this Nodalida'21 paper](https://aclanthology.org/2021.nodalida-main.29/)
* The annotation guidelines of the data are [on arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.07499)
