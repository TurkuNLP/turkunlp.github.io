title: FinGPT-3
---

We have trained generative [GPT-3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPT-3)-like models for Finnish. We are currently in the process of evaluating and documenting the models and finalizing their release.

Prior to the full release, we are offering access to some of the
models via the Hugging Face model repository:

* [Finnish GPT-3 small](https://huggingface.co/TurkuNLP/gpt3-finnish-small)
* [Finnish GPT-3 medium](https://huggingface.co/TurkuNLP/gpt3-finnish-medium)
* [Finnish GPT-3 large](https://huggingface.co/TurkuNLP/gpt3-finnish-large)
* [Finnish GPT-3 xl](https://huggingface.co/TurkuNLP/gpt3-finnish-xl)
* [Finnish GPT-3 3B](https://huggingface.co/TurkuNLP/gpt3-finnish-3B)
* [Finnish GPT-3 8B](https://huggingface.co/TurkuNLP/gpt3-finnish-8B)
* [Finnish GPT-3 13B](https://huggingface.co/TurkuNLP/gpt3-finnish-13B)
* BLOOM + Finnish 176B *coming soon!*

You can also find a simple example of generating text with these models
